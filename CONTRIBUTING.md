You may want to contribute your own tests and benchmarks, fixes to existing benchmarks, or simply providing your own results.

## Providing new tests
A pull request containing new benchmarks must include properly formatted directory layout, as well as the benchmark code and a README.md file summarizing the test and their results. For each pull request, I will personally test it to make sure that the results are accurate and not-skewed.
