This benchmark compares the two methods, that I am aware of, that can be used to push a value to the end of an array. These methods are:
* Array#push
* Array#<<

## Result
```
       user       system      total       real
push  0.250000   0.060000   0.310000   (0.396639)
<<    0.220000   0.060000   0.280000   (0.330068)
```
