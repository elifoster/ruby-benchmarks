# ruby-benchmarks
A repository full of Ruby benchmarks and their results.

The purpose of this repository is to see differences in Ruby methods' performance. I will try to remain neutral in my READMEs, however these results in some cases can be so extreme that the results themselves will bring non-neutrality.

Each folder in the benchmarks folder will have their own Ruby source code files containing the benchmarks, and a README containing their results and a summary of the test. The directory might have sub-directories, if necessary due to many tests relating to one subject.

Please see CONTRIBUTING.md to see how to contribute new benchmarks and new results.
